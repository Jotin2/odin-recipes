TOP HTML Project

This project will use my HTML knowledge that I have acuired through The Odin Project into practice. 
In this case, a basic recipe website will be built.

After finishing the project, I am much more comfortable with creating an HTML boilerplate that 
my four .html files all used. In addition to that, I am more familiar with utilizing the basic 
tags such as <html>, <head>, <body>, <h1>, <p>, <ul>, <ol>, <li>, <a href="">, and <img src="">.

The most important part of this project that I would consider the most fufilling part was 
utilizing git commands in conjunction with building the recipie website. Considering when to
git add and git commit was something I kept in mind and was very useful in practicing.
